# Trivia
My interest in creating this app was to demonstrate what knowledge I have using CSS, HTML, and Javascript using the DOM and API. I used a trivia database API to help bring my app to life. I was trying to recreate in making a game from the questions and answers.
On the first page, it is very introductory for the player to get into the app and to initiate with inputting their name. Then from the there would get to the next page where he/she would go through a question of Trivia and see if they can get the right answer.
